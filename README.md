## Project Description

#### Public Part

- The public part consists of register and login pages.

#### Private Part

- After a successful login, users are redirected to the main page which is split into two main parts: filters on the left-hand side and VR scans on the right-hand side. Users can use the filters as well as the search box to filter the VR scans.
- VR Scans are lazy-loaded - current viewport plus a small buffer is fetched.
- Favorites feature is also present which allows adding certain VR scans to a personal 'favorites' list for easy access later on.
- Users can save all currently selected filters using the 'presets' feature. Saving filters as presets allows one to go back to a previous filter selection simply by clicking on the desired preset.
- User details page is present and can be accessed by the top navigation menu. Users can edit their personal details like first and last name, email and profile picture.
